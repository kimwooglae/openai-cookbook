# OpenAI Cookbook

The OpenAI Cookbook shares example code for accomplishing common tasks with the [OpenAI API].

To run these examples, you'll need an OpenAI account and API key ([create a free account][api signup]).

Most code examples are written in Python, though the concepts can be applied in any language.

- [Faithful Reasoning Using Large Language Models (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14271): Reasoning can be improved by a system that combines: chains of thought generated by alternative selection and inference prompts, a halter model that chooses when to halt selection-inference loops, a value function to search over multiple reasoning paths, and sentence labels that help avoid hallucination.
- [STaR: Bootstrapping Reasoning With Reasoning (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14465): Chain of thought reasoning can be baked into models via fine-tuning. For tasks with an answer key, example chains of thoughts can be generated by language models.
- [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629): For tasks with tools or an environment, chain of thought works better you prescriptively alternate between **Re**asoning steps (thinking about what to do) and **Act**ing (getting information from a tool or environment).
- [Reflexion: an autonomous agent with dynamic memory and self-reflection (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366): Retrying tasks with memory of prior failures improves subsequent performance.
