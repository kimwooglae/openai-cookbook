    "GPT-3는 너무 커서 컨텍스트 창에 맞지 않는 문서에서 주요 수치, 날짜 또는 기타 중요한 콘텐츠를 추출하는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 이 문제를 해결하기 위한 한 가지 접근 방식은 문서를 청크로 분할하고 각 청크를 개별적으로 처리한 다음 하나의 답변 목록으로 결합하는 것입니다. \n",

    "이 노트북에서는 이 방법을 실행해 보겠습니다:\n",
    "- 긴 PDF를 불러와서 텍스트 추출하기\n",
    "- 핵심 정보를 추출하는 데 사용할 프롬프트 만들기\n",

    "GPT-3 can help us extract key figures, dates or other bits of important content from documents that are too big to fit into the context window. One approach for solving this is to chunk the document up and process each chunk separately, before combining into one list of answers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll run through this approach:\n",
    "- Load in a long PDF and pull the text out\n",
    "- Create a prompt to be used to extract key bits of information\n",
    "- Chunk up our document and process each chunk to pull any answers out\n",
    "- Combine them at the end\n",
    "- This simple approach will then be extended to three more difficult questions\n",

    "    - 텍스트 청크를 입력으로 받아 프롬프트와 결합하여 응답을 가져오는 함수를 만듭니다.\n",
    "    - 스크립트를 실행하여 텍스트를 청크하고 답변을 추출하여 구문 분석을 위해 출력하기\n",
    "- **복잡한 엔티티 추출**: 더 어려운 추론이 필요한 몇 가지 더 어려운 질문을 해보세요.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Setup**: Take a PDF, a Formula 1 Financial Regulation document on Power Units, and extract the text from it for entity extraction. We'll use this to try to extract answers that are buried in the content.\n",
    "- **Simple Entity Extraction**: Extract key bits of information from chunks of a document by:\n",
    "    - Creating a template prompt with our questions and an example of the format it expects\n",
    "    - Create a function to take a chunk of text as input, combine with the prompt and get a response\n",
    "    - Run a script to chunk the text, extract answers and output them for parsing\n",
