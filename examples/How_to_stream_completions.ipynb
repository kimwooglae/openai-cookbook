    "# 완료를 스트리밍하는 방법\n",
    "\n",
    "기본적으로 OpenAI에 완료를 요청하면 전체 완료가 생성된 후 단일 응답으로 다시 전송됩니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "긴 완료를 생성하는 경우 응답을 기다리는 데 몇 초가 걸릴 수 있습니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "응답을 더 빨리 받으려면 완료가 생성되는 동안 완료를 '스트리밍'할 수 있습니다. 이렇게 하면 전체 완료가 완료되기 전에 완료의 시작 부분부터 인쇄 또는 처리를 시작할 수 있습니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "완료를 스트리밍하려면 채팅 완료 또는 완료 엔드포인트를 호출할 때 `stream=True`를 설정하세요. 그러면 응답을 [데이터 전용 서버 전송 이벤트](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format)로 스트리밍하는 객체가 반환됩니다. `메시지` 필드가 아닌 `델타` 필드에서 청크를 추출합니다.\n",

    "\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, when you request a completion from the OpenAI, the entire completion is generated before being sent back in a single response.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're generating long completions, waiting for the response can take many seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get responses sooner, you can 'stream' the completion as it's being generated. This allows you to start printing or processing the beginning of the completion before the full completion is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "To stream completions, set `stream=True` when calling the chat completions or completions endpoints. This will return an object that streams back the response as [data-only server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format). Extract chunks from the `delta` field rather than the `message` field.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 단점\n",
    "\n",
    "프로덕션 애플리케이션에서 `stream=True`를 사용하면 부분 완료를 평가하기가 더 어려울 수 있으므로 완료 내용을 조정하기가 더 어려워집니다. 이는 [승인된 사용](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines)에 영향을 미칩니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "스트리밍 응답의 또 다른 작은 단점은 응답에 더 이상 얼마나 많은 토큰이 소비되었는지 알려주는 '사용량' 필드가 포함되지 않는다는 것입니다. 모든 응답을 수신하고 결합한 후, [`tiktoken`](How_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken.ipynb)를 사용하여 직접 계산할 수 있습니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that using `stream=True` in a production application makes it more difficult to moderate the content of the completions, as partial completions may be more difficult to evaluate. which has implications for [approved usage](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another small drawback of streaming responses is that the response no longer includes the `usage` field to tell you how many tokens were consumed. After receiving and combining all of the responses, you can calculate this yourself using [`tiktoken`](How_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken.ipynb).\n",
